# Mistral-web-RAG
For this project, I used ollama and langchain comunity to build a RAG concerning web pages.

# Streamlit
For this app, I also chose to use the library streamlit, so it could provide me with a web 
API page, to give the links of my interest and also to deliver my question.
Instead of using Flask or even FastAPI, it can a be great opportunity if you don't want
to invest much of your time in this specific part.
